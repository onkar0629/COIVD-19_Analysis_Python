# COVID-19 Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes the global spread of COVID-19 using confirmed case datasets. The study explores key trends, growth rates, and the relationship between economic indicators (e.g., GDP per capita) and infection rates.

## 📊 Datasets Used
1. **COVID-19 Confirmed Cases Dataset**: Contains global case counts by country over time.
2. **Worldwide Happiness Report**: Includes GDP per capita and other economic indicators to analyze their correlation with COVID-19 infection rates.

## 🔑 Key Findings
- **The United States** had the highest total cases (~1.07M), followed by **Spain and Italy**.
- **Brazil (55.87%) and Russia (50.78%)** had the highest growth rates in the last 7 days.
- A scatter plot analysis explored the correlation between **GDP per capita and maximum infection rates**.

## 📈 Visualizations
- **Total COVID-19 cases per country** (bar chart).
- **Growth rate of new cases in the last 7 days** (bar chart).
- **Scatter plot of GDP per capita vs. max infection rates**.
